# Stock Analysis (Challenge 2)

---

## Project Overview

The purpose of this exercise is to "Refactor" the Stocks Analysis' code. The intention is not to change any process, but to optimize the way the calculations are done.

In this case, instead of looping **"12 times"** over the entire table to get data for all the Tickers (one at the time), an array will gather and store the required information in one iteration.
